# What
This is the back end of a [website](https://milken-institute.gn-works.com/) that allows users to chat with a large language model (GPT 4) about the [Milken Institute](https://milkeninstitute.org/), a 503C non-profit. 

## Why

As a recipient of the Milken Scholarship, I wanted to see if this chat tool could help the Milken Institute

## Comments

This website also has a back end written in Python - [another repository](https://github.com/GuralTOO/milken_chat)

## How

The data was scraped from the Milken Institute Website, cleaned, and stored in a vector database on a server. Now, the website is accessible at [https://milken-institute.gn-works.com/](https://milken-institute.gn-works.com/)
